# SSR vs CSR vs Hydration

Server-side rendering, or SSR, generates a page's full HTML on the server before sending it to the browser, so crawlers receive complete content immediately. Client-side rendering, or CSR, sends a mostly empty page and builds the content using JavaScript in the browser, which can be harder for some crawlers to process. Hydration is a hybrid approach where a server-rendered page is sent first, then JavaScript takes over in the browser to make it interactive, aiming to combine the crawlability of SSR with the interactivity of CSR.
